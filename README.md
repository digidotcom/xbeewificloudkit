XBee Wi-Fi Cloud Kit
===================

The XBee Wi-Fi Cloud Kit helps users quickly connect XBee Wi-Fi enabled devices
to the Internet of Things. This is the source code for the web application for
the XBee Wi-Fi Cloud Kit. This source has been
contributed by [Digi International][Digi].

  * The web application allows the user to quickly create a dashboard of widgets
    to communicate with and control their XBee Wi-Fi Cloud Kit.

  * With this source code, you can run your own instance of the application in
    Heroku, and customize it to your needs, including creating new types of
    widgets and extending the application's functionality.

Requirements
------------

This application should run in Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, provided the
necessary programs are installed.  These are:

  * The [Heroku Toolbelt][toolbelt]

  * [Python 2.7][py27]

  * [node.js][node]

[toolbelt]: http://toolbelt.herokuapp.com/
[py27]: http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/
[node]: http://nodejs.org/

Installing node.js will also install NPM, node.js's package manager. Using NPM,
install [Grunt][grunt] and [Bower][bower]:

    $ npm install -g grunt-cli
    $ npm install -g bower

Install [pip][pip], the Python package manager, to handle the installation of
the application's Python dependencies.

[grunt]: http://gruntjs.com
[bower]: https://github.com/bower/bower
[pip]: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html

Installation
------------

Once you have checked out the source code from Git, navigate to the root
directory of the code and run

    $ npm install
    $ bower install
    $ grunt heroku:production

to install all Node modules required for developing the front-end application.
This installation process will also use Bower to download the necessary
front-end dependencies, and use Grunt to build the code.

For Windows machines only:
--------------------------

Follow the directions for full setup of Python on Windows including setup of
your PATH environment variable, ez_setup.py and get-pip.py:

http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/

Download and install gevent-0.13.8 for Python 2.7.  Use 
gevent-0.13.8.win32-py2.7.msi from [gevent][gevent].

Download and install psycopg2 for Python 2.7.  Use 
psycopg2-2.5.1.win32-py2.7-pg9.2.4-release.exe from [win-psycopg][psycopg].

You must have a C compiler installed so that pip can build some of the required
packages, typically this means you need Microsoft Visual Studio Express
for C/C++ from the [Microsoft Downloads site][microsoft].  Python 2.7 was built
with Microsoft Visual Studio 2008, so if you do not have it, use
2010 and run: 

    C:\set VS90COMNTOOLS=%VS100COMNTOOLS%

Finally, run

    C:\pip install -r requirements.WINDOWS.txt

to install the Python module dependencies needed for the application.  Note
this is the step that requires the C compiler.  If you see the error
"Unable to find vcvarsall.bat", then setup.py cannot locate your C compiler 
environment.

[microsoft]: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/
[gevent]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gevent
[psycopg]: http://stickpeople.com/projects/python/win-psycopg/

For Linux and Mac:
------------------

Run
    C:\ pip install -r requirements.txt

to install the Python module dependencies
needed for the application.



App setup for Heroku
--------------------------------

## Heroku setup

Deploying a version of this application for your own use requires a [Heroku
account][heroku] and the [Heroku command line toolbelt][heroku_dev].

1. Create a new Heroku app

        $ heroku create *appname*

1. Configure the new app to use multi-buildpacks (NodeJS & python in our case)

        $ heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi.git

1. Deploy the application code to Heroku

        $ git push heroku master

1. Provision the database for the app

        $ heroku run python manage.py syncdb

[heroku]: http://www.heroku.com/
[heroku_dev]: http://toolbelt.herokuapp.com/

## Setup to run app locally:

1. Run the grunt build

        $ grunt build

1. Provision the database

        $ python manage.py syncdb

1. Start the back-end server

        $ foreman start

foreman should be included with the [Heroku Toolbelt][heroku_dev]
[heroku_dev]: http://toolbelt.herokuapp.com/

XBee Wi-Fi Cloud Kit (Front-end)
=========

To enable more rapid development, the front-end application can be easily hosted
on a local computer. This front-end shell will communicate with the back-end
server which has been previously deployed to Heroku.

## Getting started

If you followed the steps in 'Installation' above, you should be ready to
develop and build the front-end source code.
Running `npm install` should have automatically run `bower install`, which will
download the dependencies of the application
([Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), [jQuery](http://jquery.com), etc).
Check that `bower install` was run by examining the contents of the `vendor/`
directory; if it does not contain such subdirectories as `bootstrap`, `raphael`,
and `angular`, you will need to run the `bower install` command again.

Run `grunt build` to gather all the necessary files into the build/ directory
and run unit tests. Run `grunt build-notest` to gather the files without running
unit tests.

Finally, start the mock back-end server with

    $ node server.js build <heroku_app_name>

and open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`. This server allows the
front-end application to run on your local machine without running into
cross-site scripting errors. The server simply pipes requests and responses to
and from the RESTful API of the your Heroku instance. The command

    $ PORT=9000 node server.js build <heroku_app_name>

 will run the local server at a different port, if this is necessary or desired.


**Note:** You may choose to run the Django back-end server locally, rather than
use the mock Node server to forward requests to a Heroku instance. See "Setup to
run app locally" above for more information on how to do so.


## Application structure

The application front-end is built off of Josh David Miller's
[ng-boilerplate](http://bit.ly/ngBoilerplate) project template.

#### Widgets

Widgets in the `/src/app/widgets` are considered "built-in" widgets. Additional
widgets should be placed in `/src/common/widgets`. In general, widgets have a
template, a controller, and a set of unit tests. Most widgets with a heavy UI
component have their UI abstracted into a directive in the
`/src/common/directives` folder. Generally, a widget's controller should be
responsible for handling data updates, while the directive should be responsible
for how the UI responds to those updates. The widget's template usually just has
a single HTML element that instantiates the proper directive.

#### Services

Services in the `/src/app/services/` directory are accessible by all parts of
the application, and are useful for calculations and data that need to be
accessible in multiple places. Creating a new widget generally won't involve
creating a new service.

#### Controllers

Most controllers in the application are paired with their respective templates.
Again, controllers are used to handle what application logic should occur when
data is received either from the device or from user input.

#### Directives

Directives should control how the application UI reacts to user input or new
data from the device. Directives for widget UI elements exist in
`/src/common/directives`. Directives for different pages of the application
(such as widget\_settings) exist with the other code in their respective page's
directory.

#### Unit Tests

Jasmine unit tests are differentiated by ending in `.spec.js`. The build system
is able to differentiate unit tests from application files in this manner, which
allows unit tests to exist right next to the tested code. Theoretically, all
application code should have a unit test.

<br>

## Widgets

Dashboard widgets are loaded from the back-end server via the
/api/dashboards API. This is an example of a simple dashboard widget model:

    {
        device: "00000000-00000000-00409DFF-FF111111",
        id: "widget_1234567",
        type: "switch",
        label: "Switch #1",
        sets: "DIO/3"
    }

This widget model is used by the Cloud Kit application to generate a switch
widget, labeled "Switch #1", which can be used to set the state of DIO3 on
the device 00000000-00000000-00409DFF-FF111111.

The precise fields required on a widget model will vary depending on the type
specified, but every widget must specify the following four fields:

- `id`: string used to uniquely identify the widget
- `device`: ID of the device this widget is associated with (specifically, this
  device ID is used in conjunction with any stream/pin settings to map input
and output to/from the correct device)
- `type`: widget type key, specifying what type of widget to render
- `label`: string label to display at the top of the widget

See [Widget Settings API](#widget-settings-api) for more details on widget
settings.

### Built-In Widget Types

The XBee Wi-Fi Cloud Kit application is designed to be extensible, and to make
it very easy for the user to create their own custom widget types. We have,
however, provided a small set of built-in, generic widgets, to provide insight
into widget design and as a starting point for your dashboard.

The following widget types are provided with the Cloud Kit application:

- __Gauge Widget__ (`gauge`): draws a circular, speedometer-like gauge, to
  render the value of a datastream between a low and high value. See
  [JustGage](http://justgage.com)
    - "Units" (`units`): String label for gauge to display the units of the
      values
    - "Input Transform" (`transform`): See [data transforms](#data-transforms)
    - "Low value" (`low`): Number value, the low end of the gauge
    - "High value" (`high`): Number value, the high end of the gauge. Must be
      greater than the low value

- __Line Graph Widget__ (`line-graph`): draws data in a chronological line graph.
    See [FlotCharts](http://www.flotcharts.org)
    - "Input Transform" (`transform`): See [data transforms](#data-transforms)
    - "Color" (`color`): the color used for the dots and lines in the chart. Must
        be a valid CSS color (hex, RGB, or name)
    - "Timespan" (`timespan`): the range of time, in seconds, to display in the
        graph
    - "X-axis tick size" (`ticksize`): the spacing, in seconds, between ticks/lines
        drawn along the X-axis of the chart

- __Progress Bar Widgets__ (`progress`/`progress-vertical`): represents data values
    in a progress-bar view. Widget settings allow you to set the low and high values
    for the bar. Vertical and horizontal versions of the widget exist.
    - "Input Transform" (`transform`): see [data transforms](#data-transforms)
    - "Low value" (`low`): low-end value for the progress bar
    - "High value" (`high`): high-end value for the progress bar

- __Serial Data Widget__ (`serial`): presents an view for interacting with the
    serial port (UART) of the Cloud Kit board. Text sent to the board appears in
    blue and data received from the board appears in red
    - This widget has no custom options

- __Slider Widget__ (`slider`): allows the user to drag a slider to choose a value
    to set down to the device. See [jQuery UI docs](http://api.jqueryui.com/slider)
    - "PWM Output" (`pwm`): dropdown menu to select the PWM output to write to
    - "Low value" (`low`): low-end value for the slider
    - "High value" (`high`): high-end value for the slider
    - "Step Size" (`step`): slider step size (spacing between 'snaps') - default 1

- __Switch Widget__ (`switch`): presents a flip-switch widget to toggle values on/off
    - "Invert Values" (`invert`): checkbox - if checked, the switch moving to "On"
        sends a 0 to the device, and "Off" sends a 1
    - "Read-Only Switch" (`read_only`): checkbox - if checked, the switch will
        only represent the data stream value last received from the server, i.e.
        it will not be interactive

- __Tilt Widget__ (`tilt`): Creates a two-dimensional display which represents
      the output of the acellerometer in the kit, similar to a two-dimensional
      bubble level.
    - "X-Axis Stream" (`stream_x`): dropdown menu to select the data stream
        represented on the X axis of the widget
    - "Y-Axis Stream" (`stream_y`): dropdown menu to select the data stream
        represented on the Y axis of the widget

- __Timeout Slider Widget__ (`timeout`): Allows the timeout to be changed for
      components of the kit which require one, such as the buzzer.
    - "Setting" (`setting`): dropdown menu to select the XBee module timeout
        setting that this widget will write to
    - "Low value" (`low`): the low-end value of the slider (see Slider Widget)
    - "High value" (`high`): the high-end value of the slider (see Slider Widget)
    - "Step Size" (`step`): slider step size (see Slider Widget)


### Creating Your Own Widgets

The XBee Wi-Fi Cloud Kit allows you to create your own widget types from
scratch. To start, open a command line and run `grunt widget`.

    <u>Running "widget" task</u>
    Widget type (e.g. led): *led*
    Type description (e.g. LED Widget): *LED Widget*
    Created new widget definition in /home/mike/xbeewifi/src/common/widgets/ledCustomWidget
    The widget type key is: led-custom
    The description of the widget is: LED Widget

After running this command and inputting the necessary information, Grunt will
generate the files for the new widget in /src/common/widgets (the exact path
can be found in Grunt's output). You can edit the widget template and directive
files there, re-build the application, and you will see the new widget type
appear in the widget type dropdown menu on the Add Widget page.

<br>
## Widget Settings API

User-configurable settings for widgets are defined within each widget type's
"registry specification" (the object passed into the call to
`widgetRegistry.put` at the bottom of the widget's associated run block). These
settings are built on the
[Revalidator](https://github.com/flatiron/revalidator#schema) API.

The following is an example of a basic widget setting definition:

    {
      key: "example",
      label: "My Example Setting",
      type: "string",
      required: false,
      "default": "Hello"
    }

- `key`: a unique name/key for this setting; used to identify this setting in a
  widget's JSON representation, and for creating the widget settings form
- `label`: a string used to label the form input associated with this setting on
  the widget settings form
- `type`: used by Revalidator to check the data type of the setting
- `required`: used by Revalidator to specify if this setting must be specified
  in the widget's JSON representation
- `default`: used by the Cloud Kit to auto-populate this setting if required is
  __false__ and no value is specified

(Note: the word 'default' __MUST__ be placed in quotes. If not, older versions
of IE will raise an error because 'default' is a reserved keyword.)


### Widget Settings Formats

By default, widget settings will be rendered (displayed) on the widget settings
page as basic text input fields. The type of input field is determined by the
`type` attribute set in the settings object:

- `string`: a basic text input, suitable for names and titles.
- `integer` or `number`: an HTML `<input type="number">`, which will display a
  number-picker on Chrome and other browsers supporting this feature. (Other
  browsers will just display a text input).
- `boolean`: a checkbox

In addition to these types of form elements, setting the `form` attribute in
the widget setting object will alter how the input is displayed. These formats
allow for more semantic form elements and more useful validation. The available
options are:

- `color`: a text input field, with a small box next to it. Input in the field
  must be a valid hex or rgb color specification, or match a name provided by
  [jQuery Color][jquery_color]. Valid colors will be displayed in the
  square; invalid colors will replace the square with a red crossed-out circle.
- `stream`: a dropdown menu, presenting all possible data streams served up by
  the XBee Wi-Fi device
- `pin`: a dropdown menu, presenting all possible streams/settings which can be
  written out to
- `pwm`: a dropdown menu, presenting all PWM outputs available
- `timeout`: a dropdown menu, presenting all XBee module settings corresponding
  to timeouts for pins

[jquery_color]: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color#jquery-color

As an example, the following widget settings object

    {
        key: "max",
        label: "Max Value",
        type: "integer",
        required: "false",
        "default": 30,
    }

would create a form element similar to the one below:

<div>
<label> Max Value: </label>
<input type="number" name="opt" min="5" max="1800" placeholder="30">
</div>

#### Data Transforms

As noted in the Built-in Widget Types section, multiple widgets have a
`transform` setting. This setting allows incoming data to be processed with an
expression for display. The transform field is implemented using Angular.js's
`$eval` function. This function will only evaluate basic [Angular
expressions][angular_exp] without side affects, so one doesn't have to worry
about users inserting malicious code into the application.

For instance, imagine a temperature sensor that reported a number between 0
(corresponding to -40 degrees Fahrenheit) and 1023 (corresponding to 140 degrees
Fahrenheit). If a user wished to display this on a gauge widget as a meaningful
value in Fahrenheit as opposed to the less useful binary representation, they
could insert:

        x * (180/1024) - 40

in the Transform widget settings page. `x` in this expression is the value of
the incoming data.  To round this to the nearest whole number, the expression
can be put through an Angular filter:

        x * (180/1024) - 40 | number:0

Here `number:0` means "show as a number with 0 decimal places." Note that
because this field doesn't evaluate real JavaScript,

        Math.round((x*180/1024)-40)

 will not work correctly.

XBee Wi-Fi Cloud Kit (Back-end)
=========
The application backend is written in [Python](http://www.python.org/), using
the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework. Most users looking
to extend the dashboard with new widgets should have no need to modify this
code. However, advanced users may wish to extend the API with new functionality
or do local debugging alongside frontend changes.

The backend was designed to be relatively light-weight, largly wrapping existing
 [Device Cloud](http://www.etherios.com/products/devicecloud/) Web Services for
 use by the frontend. Users looking to extend or modify the API should first
 familizarize themselves with the Device Cloud features and API (documentation
 available [here](http://www.etherios.com/products/devicecloud/support/).
 Between these APIs and the frontend, the backend layer adds some simple
 persistence for dashboards, user authentication and session handling, and a
 channel for new data from Device Cloud to travel through down to the frontend
 client over a WebSocket connection.

## Getting started on Heroku

As part of the application setup, a number of configuration related environment
variables are checked (see [settings.py](./xbeewifiapp/settings.py)).

**The following are required to run the application:**
- `DATABASE_URL`: *Should* be set automatically by heroku during initial
deployment, as part of the postgres addon. If not, once the Heroku Postgres
(or other db layer) addon is attached, this variable can by set by running

        heroku pg:promote <FULL_DB_URL>
See [Heroku Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql#establish-primary-db) for more details

**The following should be used to set once before deployment**

Secret, unique security keys and credentials for your app:

- `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`: Random 50 character string. Randomly generated if not found.
- `AES_CRYPTO_KEY_HEX`: Random 16 Bytes, represented as string of 32 hex characters.
Used for extra encrypting of various things. Randomly generated if not found.

The following are used to customize the basic authentication crdentials used by
Device Cloud when pushing monitor events to the server:

- `DEVICE_CLOUD_MONITOR_AUTH_USER`: Username. Defaults to "change" if not found.
- `DEVICE_CLOUD_MONITOR_AUTH_PASS`: Password. Defaults to "me" if not found.

**The following are useful for debugging and local development, and may be
changed at any time:**

- `DJANGO_DEBUG`: Used to run Django in debug mode (see [documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#debug))
- `DJANGO_LOCAL_DEV`: will make Django to use a local sqlite3 file instead of
trying to connect to DATABASE_URL


## Exploring the API

The Backend incorporates an interactive API explorer which can be used to browse
the API resources and try out the calls made by the frontend. To get started,
navigate to /api from the root of the site (ex https://xbeewifi.herokuapp.com/api)

Much of the API is locked down to only authenticated users. If you are not
already logged in via the main site, you may login/logout via a link in the
upper-right corner of the page, using your Device Cloud credentials and
selecting the corresponding cloud server. Attempts to access most resources
while not authenticated will return a 403-Forbidden error.

One logged in, navigate around via the url's in each response. Each view
contains a description and other documentation related to that resource.

## Application structure

The application backend code is structured as a Django project containing a
number of django apps and plugins

### Essential 3rd party packages

A full list of dependencies can be found in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt).
To install (assuming python and pip are installed), simply run (VirtualEnv recommended)

        pip install -r requirements.txt

##### [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

The main web framework

##### [Django Rest Framework](http://django-rest-framework.org/)

The app makes heavy use of the [Django Rest Framework](http://django-rest-framework.org/)
to define and implement the API, handle authentication, and provide the browsable interface

##### [Gevent-socketio](https://github.com/abourget/gevent-socketio)

Python implmentation of Socket.IO to provide real-time communication between
browser and server

##### [dj-static](https://github.com/kennethreitz/dj-static)

Used to serve static files when running on the Heroku platform


#### Device Cloud Layer

Django extensions to support Device Cloud user models, authentication, and
wrappers around web services can be found under `xbeewifiapp\libs\digi`

#### Views

Url routing to views is done in `xbeewifiapp\urls.py`. Most view code is located
in `xbeewifiapp\apps\dashboard\views.py`. Note that most views will use the
default REST framework settings for permissions and authentication unless
annotated otherwise.

#### Data Flow

Information is retrieved from Device Cloud through a combination of querying and
 recieving push events. Most of the views defined in the API will perform an
 equivalent query against Device Cloud web services.

However, to facilitate real-time updates of sensor information, the application
creates two Device Cloud Monitors - one for device data (DataStreams), the other
 for device connectivity status (DeviceCore). These monitors will be atuomatically
  created as needed once under the account of each logged in user, and re-used
  on subsequent logins. NOTE: monitors are created pointing to the address that
  users see when interacting with your site. If the application is accessable
  via multiple routes or urls, it may lead to duplicate monitors created under
  the same user. Note too that monitors won't be created for urls such as localhost.


## Running locally

Local development is relatively simple to get started with. Users have a few
options, see the file `Procfile` for some possibilities, users may wish to
emulate the Heroku environment by running with Foreman

      foreman run

Or in the simplest case, With dependencies installed via pip, simply run Django
 directly, setting the debug variables `DJANGO_DEBUG=True` and
`DJANGO_LOCAL_DEV=True`

      python manage.py runserver_socketio "0.0.0.0:$PORT"

Note: users running the app for the first time will still need to provision the
local database (defined in settings.py or via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable)

      python manage.py syncdb

## Running on Heroku

### Addons

When the addon is deployed on the Heroku platform, there are a number of addons
users may find useful for monitoring and debug purposes. These may be attached
to your app via the Heroku [Addons Page](https://addons.heroku.com), and have
free tiers suitable for development use:

- `Heroku Scheduler`: If your application will be supporting many users, it may
be necessary to clean up old sessions periodically. A Django command to do this
can be scheduled daily by adding the task `python manage.py clearsessions`

- `New Relic`: Useful for monitoring performance characteristics and
availablility of the application. NOTE: when running with New Relic agent, a
different command is used in the Procfile

- `Papertrail`: Log management, archive, and search
